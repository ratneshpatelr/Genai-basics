The BJP lost its sole majority, with the alliance forcing Modi to govern with his coalition, the NDA.\\n\\n\\n== Etymology ==\\nThe Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, commonly known by its backronym I.N.D.I.A. is an opposition front announced by the leaders of 28 parties to contest the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The name was proposed during a meeting in Bengaluru and was unanimously adopted by the 28 participating parties. While some sources attribute the suggestion of the name to Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress (INC), others mention that it was suggested by Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and chief minister of West Bengal.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nOn September 25, 2022, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo Om Prakash Chautala hosted a rally in Fatehabad on the occasion of Former Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal\\'s birth anniversary. During this rally, the ideas of a national alliance were first openly called on stage. Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar had said \"I\\'ll urge all parties, including Congress, to get together and then they (BJP) will lost badly\". JD(U) spokesperson K. C. Tyagi had also stated that the foundation of the alliance was during this same rally.\\nThe first major Opposition parties\\' meeting, held in Patna, Bihar, was chaired by Nitish Kumar on 23 June 2023, when the proposal for a new alliance was put on the table. The meeting was attended by 16 Opposition parties. INLD was not included in this meeting.\\nThe second meeting, was held in Bengaluru, Karnataka on 17‚Äì18 July. It was chaired by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi when the proposal for an alliance was accepted and ten more parties were added to the list. The alliance\\'s name was finalized and given the name Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance.\\nThe third meeting was held in Mumbai, Maharashtra from 31 August to 1 September. The meeting was hosted by Shiv Sena (UBT) President Uddhav Thackeray and saw Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and chief ministers of 5 states in attendance. Over the two-day deliberations, the alliance discussed major electoral issues for the upcoming general elections, carved out the coordination committee, and passed a three-point resolution to fight 2024 Indian general elections together \\'as far as possible\\'.\\nThe fourth meeting was held in New Delhi on 19 December. The meeting was primarily held to discuss seat-sharing, joint rallies, and the prime ministerial face and/or convenor of the alliance. The alliance adopted a resolution to ensure maximum use of VVPATs in upcoming elections. \"To enhance confidence in elections, VVPAT slips should be directly given to voters to self-verify and place in a separate box, instead of them falling into the main box. Eventually, all VVPAT slips must be 100% counted, ensuring truly free and fair elections,\" read the resolution passed by the alliance at the meeting. Seat sharing was also to be done by either 31 December 2023 or mid-January 2024. It was also decided that protests will be held across the country on 22 December 2023 against the suspensions of opposition MPs in the Indian Parliament. Some leaders said that the alliance would hold a grand joint rally at Patna on 30 January 2024, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, although this was not officially announced.\\nThe alliance held its 5th meeting virtually with some leaders not attending.
